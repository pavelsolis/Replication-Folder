# Research Replication Folder

This repository template provides a folder structure that facilitates the reproducibility of research results. 

Reproducibility of your research results is desirable. This goal is easier to achieve if it is part of the research process, from inception to completion. The folder structure and example files in this template facilitate working on a project that is replicable. You just need to [create your project repository from the template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

The philosophy behind the folder structure and the example files is to automate as much as possible so that manual tweaks are not necessary. In this way, someone else (including yourself) can easily replicate and update your results.

Once you have created your project repository from the template, delete this file (README.md) from the folder and change the name of the file README-Project.md to README.md so that the description of your specific project is the main page of your repository. Use the lines below if you want to make this from the Terminal.
```bash
$ cd path/to/repository/created/from/template
$ rm README.md
$ mv README-Project.md README.md
```
