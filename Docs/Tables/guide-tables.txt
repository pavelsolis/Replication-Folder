Considerations:
- Each table is composed of two files:
	- A float file containing the essence of the table (e.g., contents of entries, rules).
	- A main file that will have all the details of the table (e.g., title, label, notes) and that will call the float file.
- In this way, the details of the table can be updated without having to re-run the codes.
- Each main table file has a preamble so that it can generate a standalone PDF file for the table. Files (e.g., sections.tex, appendix.tex) calling the main table file, skip that preamble.

Recommendations:
- To facilitate referencing the tables, use the same file name as the label for the table. For example, filename 'extabpdf' and label '\label{tab:extabpdf}'.
- Make sure the tables have a consistent format throughout the paper and that the latest versions are used in the slides as in the paper.
- Run the XXXX main latex file XXXX to generate standalone PDF versions for all the tables.

Notes:
- The \tabnotes command handles the notes below a table.
- The \estauto command  handles float table files generated by Stata.
- Both commands are defined in macros.tex.
- Standalone, toggle longnotes for paper vs slides
