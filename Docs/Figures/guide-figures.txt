Considerations:
- Each main figure file has a preamble so that it can generate a standalone PDF file for the figure. Files (e.g., sections.tex, appendix.tex) calling the main figure file, skip that preamble.

Recommendations:
- To facilitate referencing the figures, use the same file name as the label for the figure. For example, filename 'exfigpdf' and label '\label{fig:exfigpdf}'.
- Make sure the figures have a consistent format throughout the paper and that the latest versions are used in the slides as in the paper.
- If possible, for the labels in the figures:
	- Use the same font as in the paper.
	- Verify they are horizontally aligned.
- Run the XXXX main latex file XXXX to generate standalone PDF versions for all the figures.

Notes:
- The \fignote and \fignotes commands handle the notes below a figure. Both commands are defined in macros.tex.
