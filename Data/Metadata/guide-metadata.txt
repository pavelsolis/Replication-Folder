The study considers two types of data files:
- The Raw folder contains the original data files downloaded from different sources. 
- The Analytic folder contains the analysis data files generated after cleaning and processing the original data files.

Recommendations:
- All the original and analysis data files used in the paper should be listed in metadata.docx. The information for each file should serve as a codebook for a user to work with and interpret the data appropriately.
- Add an entry for a file in metadata.docx:
	- Each time you obtain a new original data file.
	- Each time you generate a new analysis data file.
- Register the date in the respective entry for a file in metadata.docx:
	- Each time an original data file is updated.
	- Each time codes in the Tidy folder generate or update an analysis data file.

Considerations:
- Excel files are excluded from updates to the remote repository (which can be reverted by commenting the \*.xls\* line in the *.gitignore file*) because:
	- Very large files (> 100 MB) do not work well in version control (they are often duplicated in the history).
	- GitHub limits the size of files to 50 MB.
- Data files with an Excel extension are thus not included in the replication folder. They can be shared, however, by posting them online or by using a cloud-based solution.
- When collaborating, designate a person responsible for having the latest version of the Excel files and for sharing them.
- Other data file extensions (e.g., .csv, .mat, .dta) are not explicitly excluded but be aware of the 50 MB limit.
