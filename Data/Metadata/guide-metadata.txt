The study considers two types of data files:
- The Raw folder contains the original data files downloaded from different sources. 
- The Analytic folder contains the analysis data files generated after cleaning and processing the original data files.

Recommendations:
- Each time you obtain a new original data file, add an entry for that file in metadata.docx.
- Register the date in the respective entry for a file in metadata.docx:
	- Each time an original data file is updated.
	- Each time codes in the Tidy folder generate or update an analysis data file.
- All the original and analysis data files used in the paper should be listed in metadata.docx.

Considerations:
- Very large files (> 100 MB) do not work well in version control because they are often duplicated in the history.
- GitHub limits the size of files to 50 MB.
- For these reasons, Excel files are excluded from updates to the remote repository (this behavior can be reverted by commenting the \*.xls\* line in the *.gitignore file*).
- So, generally original data files (with an Excel extension) are not included in the replication folder. They can be shared, however, by posting the file online or by using a cloud-based solution.
- When collaborating, designate the person responsible for having the latest version of the Excel files and for sharing them.
- Other data file extensions (e.g., .csv, .mat, .dta) are not explicitly excluded but be aware of the 50 MB limit.
